# JavaScriptProjects
 
This repository will contain all my coding projects done using JavaScript through The Tech Academy assignments.

I practiced javascript by created a Pizza menu project, a tic-tac-toe game, and a simple calculator.

The pizza menu project included a multiple choice menu of size, meat toppings and vegetable toppings.  The menu then adds up the total price of choices made and provides a receipt.

The tic-tac-toe game starts a game with a computer.  Each player takes turns placing an x or an o and first to line up 3 wins.

The basic calculator can add, subtract, multiply, and divide.
